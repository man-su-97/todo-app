# Todo App

This is a simple to-do app that allows you to create, read, update, and delete tasks. It uses Node.js for the server and Vanilla JavaScript for frontend DOM manipulation.

## Getting Started

To run the app, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd todo-app
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

1. Start the Node.js server by running:

   ```bash
   node todoServer.withoutFile.js or 
   node todoServer.file.js 
   ```

   This will start the server on port 3000.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. You can now interact with the Todo app:

   - Add new tasks by entering a task description and clicking the "Add Task" button.
   - Mark tasks as complete by clicking the checkbox next to each task.
   - Edit tasks by clicking the "Edit" button, making changes, and clicking "Save."
   - Delete tasks by clicking the "Delete" button.

4. Your tasks will be saved on the server, so you can close and reopen the app without losing your data.
